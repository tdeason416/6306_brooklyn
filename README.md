### Analysis:

	* The data shows there is a strong coorelation between house value and land square footage in single family homes only.  This relationship does not hold true when condos are included, and there seem to be some outliers.  This relationship is especially visible on a log-log scale.  Based on this data, it also appears that most of the single family homes being sold in Brooklyn are close to 1000 square feet with a few being slightly larger, and many being around 600 square feet; however, the marjority of houses seem to be within 20% of 1000 square feet.
